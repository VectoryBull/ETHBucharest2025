### 💡 Project Name  
**SmartTrack**

---

### 🔍 One-liner  
A hardware-powered shipment monitoring system that uses real-time sensor data and smart contracts to automate payments and ensure delivery quality.

---

### 🧠 Problem  
Sensitive cargo like food, electronics, or pharmaceuticals often suffers from mishandling or exposure to harsh environments during transit. Disputes arise between parties, and there’s no transparent or automated way to verify shipment integrity or trigger fair payment or refunds. Additionally, logistics companies lack insight into road quality, which can impact delivery reliability.

---

### 🛠️ Solution  
SmartTrack monitors shipment conditions using a custom hardware device and automates payment settlements through smart contracts. If temperature, humidity, or vibration levels cross predefined thresholds, the contract automatically releases or refunds funds without dispute.

The system also aggregates and resells road condition data to logistics providers and infrastructure planners. Additionally, it can track and share environmental pollution levels (e.g. air quality, humidity) with users in real-time.

This aligns with AKASHA's mission of bringing public data access to communities—such as Zuzalu—by enabling transparency, awareness, and shared decision-making around transportation and environmental conditions.
