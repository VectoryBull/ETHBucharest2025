### 💡 Project Name  
**SmartTrack**

---

### 🔍 One-liner  
A hardware-powered shipment monitoring system that uses real-time sensor data and smart contracts to automate payments and ensure delivery quality.

### 🧠 Problem  
Transporting sensitive cargo —such as food, electronics, and pharmaceuticals— presents significant challenges due to their vulnerability to environmental conditions and handling procedures. Exposure to factors like temperature fluctuations, excessive humidity, or physical shocks can compromise product integrity, leading to spoilage, malfunctions, or reduced efficacy. For instance, pharmaceuticals require strict temperature control during transit to maintain their effectiveness. citeturn0search6

When such cargo arrives damaged, determining the root cause becomes complex, often resulting in disputes among manufacturers, logistics providers, and recipients. The absence of transparent mechanisms to verify shipment conditions complicates accountability and the resolution of claims. This lack of clarity can lead to increased financial losses and strained business relationships.

Additionally, logistics companies frequently operate without comprehensive insights into road quality and real-time environmental conditions. Poor road infrastructure can exacerbate cargo handling issues, increasing the risk of damage during transit. Limited visibility into these factors hampers the ability to proactively plan routes and implement measures to safeguard sensitive shipments, ultimately impacting delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.

### 🛠️ Solution  
​SmartTrack monitors shipment conditions using custom hardware devices and automates payment settlements through smart contracts. If temperature, humidity, vibration levels, or rapid variations in these parameters exceed predefined thresholds, the contract automatically releases or refunds funds without dispute.​

We utilize Request's invoicing system for billing and creating new shipments. All data we collect and process is encrypted and signed on the Arbitrum network.​

The system aggregates and resells road condition data to logistics providers and infrastructure planners. Additionally, it tracks and shares environmental pollution levels, such as air quality and humidity, with users in real-time.​

Our system also supports stationary sensors installed in various locations to monitor environmental factors like air quality. This aligns with AKASHA's mission of providing public data access to communities, such as Zuzalu, by promoting transparency, awareness, and shared decision-making regarding transportation and environmental conditions.​

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Users  
- **Logistics and supply chain companies**: They can monitor the quality of shipments, ensuring goods are transported under optimal conditions and reducing disputes.
- **Insurance providers for transit goods**: In case of damaged goods upon delivery, the root cause can be traced back to environmental conditions during transit, streamlining claims and improving accountability.
- **Cold chain and pharmaceutical distributors**: These sectors require strict monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions, ensuring compliance and product integrity throughout the supply chain.
- **High-quality and precision device manufacturers**: Vibration monitoring is crucial for sensitive equipment. Excessive vibrations could lead to damage, and our system helps prevent this by alerting to unsafe conditions.
- **Municipalities and infrastructure planners**: They can use road condition data to identify areas with frequent bumps or damage, which helps with urban planning and infrastructure improvements.
- **Truck and automotive manufacturers**: Our system provides insights into road conditions, which can be used to improve vehicle suspensions and enhance the overall driving experience.
